# TryHackMe Industrial Intrusion CTF: Complete YouTube Walkthroughs for Every Room

## Hack the TryHackMe Industrial Intrusion CTF with My YouTube Walkthroughs

**[TryHackMe Industrial Intrusion CTF link]( https://tryhackme.com/room/industrial-intrusion )**

*The Virelia Water Control Facility is back online after a devastating malware attack, but something’s not right. Flickering sensors, erratic valve pressures, and untraceable alerts hint at a hidden threat: a covert second-stage implant left by a cunning attacker. As a red team specialist for Black Echo, your mission in the TryHackMe Industrial Intrusion CTF is to infiltrate the compromised industrial control systems (ICS), outsmart a reactive adversary, and stop a catastrophic kill-switch. This action-packed Capture The Flag event is a thrilling blend of puzzles, hacking, and real-world ICS scenarios.I’m creating detailed YouTube video walkthroughs for every room in this CTF, and my playlist is your go-to resource for conquering these challenges. Whether you’re stuck on badge authentication bypasses, Node-RED exploitation, or AES-CBC decryption, my videos break down each step clearly. In this article, I’ll list all available walkthroughs from my YouTube playlist [watch here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrY_AbzZGqt_fERswtC2yKP9OP-DzlcGw),*

*with more videos being added as I complete them. Subscribe to stay updated and let’s hack the Virelia facility together!*

## Task 3: Breach Warmup Challenge

**Overview:**  This engagement aims to find a way to open the gate by bypassing the badge authentication system.
The control infrastructure may hold a weakness: Dig in, explore, and see if you have what it takes to exploit it.
Be sure to check all the open ports, you never know which one might be your way in!

**YouTube Walkthrough:**  *[Watch Task 3 Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/1sSZb-Vefhs)*

**Key Skills:** Enumeration

## Task 5: OSINT 1

**Overview:**  Hexline, we need your help investigating the phishing attack from 3 months ago. We believe the threat actor managed to hijack our domain virelia-water.it.com and used it to host some of their infrastructure at the time. Use your OSINT skills to find information about the infrastructure they used during their campaign.

**YouTube Walkthrough:**  *[Watch Task 5 Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/EbC7GmWTtko)*

**Key Skills:** OSINT

## Task 6: OSINT 2

**Overview:**  Great work on uncovering that suspicious subdomain, Hexline. However, your work here isn’t done yet, we believe there is more.

**YouTube Walkthrough:**  *[Watch Task 6 Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/USRwXq41C3g)*

**Key Skills:** OSINT

## Task 7: OSINT 3

**Overview:**  After the initial breach, a single OT-Alert appeared in Virelia’s monthly digest—an otherwise unremarkable maintenance notice, mysteriously signed with PGP. Corporate auditors quietly removed the report days later, fearing it might be malicious. Your mission is to uncover more information about this mysterious signed PGP maintenance message.

**YouTube Walkthrough:**  *[Watch Task 7 Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/BMEyTfmEXAk)*

**Key Skills:** OSINT

## Task 10: Brr v1

**Overview:**  A forgotten HMI node deep in Virelia’s wastewater control loop still runs an outdated instance, forked from an old Mango M2M stack. 

**YouTube Walkthrough:**  *[Watch Task 10 Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/41qogM2ajKo)*

**Key Skills:** Enumeration, RCE

## Task 11: Persistence

**Overview:**  After the notorious malware strike on the Virelia Water Control Facility, phantom alerts and erratic sensor readings plague a system that was supposed to be fully remediated.

As a Black Echo red-team specialist, you must penetrate the compromised portal, unravel its hidden persistence mechanism, and neutralise the backdoor before it can be reactivated.

**YouTube Walkthrough:**  *[Watch Task 11 Walkthrough](#)*

**Key Skills:** Enumeration, LFI, YAML

## Task 13: Orcam

**Overview:**   You get an email with attachment, Microsoft docm file. with Macro enable. you need to analyses the VBA code inside the macro to get the flag.

**YouTube Walkthrough:**  *[Watch Task 13 Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/uGhuElHm1Ys)*

## Task 14: Backdoored Bus

**Overview:**   You get access to container image, and your task to find the backdoor.

**YouTube Walkthrough:**  *[Watch Task 14 Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/a3vEOOaPqDw)*

## Task 19: No Salt, No Shame

**Overview:**   To “secure” the maintenance logs, Virelia’s gateway vendor encrypted every critical entry with AES-CBC—using the plant’s code name as the passphrase and a fixed, all-zero IV. Of course, without any salt or integrity checks, it’s only obscurity, not true security. Somewhere in those encrypted records lies the actual shutdown command.

**YouTube Walkthrough:**  *[Watch Task 19 Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/5-U9fT4wm-s)*

**Key Skills:** AES-CBC, Encryption, Decryption

## Task 20: Echoed Streams

**Overview:**   Three months after the Virelia Water Control Facility was breached, OT traffic is finally back online—supposedly “fully remediated.” During a routine audit, Black Echo’s red team intercepted two back‐to‐back telemetry packets between a pump controller and the SCADA server. Curiously, both packets were encrypted under AES‐GCM using the same 16-byte nonce (number used once). The first packet is just regular facility telemetry; the second contains a hidden sabotage command with the kill-switch flag. Your job is to recover that flag and stop the attack. how to exploit one of the most dangerous cryptographic vulnerabilities - nonce reuse in AES-GCM encryption

**YouTube Walkthrough:**  *[Watch Task 20 Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/qm_mpEskURo)*

**Key Skills:** AES-GCM, Encryption, Decryption

## Task 21: CRC Me If You Can

**Overview:**   Three months after the Virelia Water Control Facility was “remediated,” flickering sensors and phantom alerts persist. A covert second-stage implant still lurks, waiting for its kill switch. As a hired red-team specialist for Black Echo, your mission is to forge a legitimate control frame that disables the implant before the real attacker flips it on.

**YouTube Walkthrough:**  *[Watch Task 21 Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/-zylGSCC6cU)*

**Overview:**   ZeroTrace intercepts a stripped-down authentication module running on a remote industrial gateway. Assembly scrolls across glowing monitors as she unpacks the logic behind the plant’s digital checkpoint

**YouTube Walkthrough:**  *[Watch Task 24 Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/BpfgPhwg5h4)*

**Key Skills:** Decompiler, Ghidra, Binary

## Task 25: Access Granted

**Overview:**   ZeroTrace intercepts a suspicious HMI login module on the plant floor. Reverse the binary logic to reveal the access key and slip past digital defences.

## Top Tips for Mastering the Industrial Intrusion CTF

Want to ace this CTF? Here are some strategies I cover in my YouTube walkthroughs:

**Enumerate Everything:** Use tools like Nmap / Rustscan / Gobuster etc.

**Think Like an Attacker:** ICS systems often have exposed dashboards or weak authentication—look for misconfigurations.

**Stay Organized:** Document your findings, including open ports and failed attempts, to avoid missing key clues.

**Practice Ethically:** Use TryHackMe’s provided machines or a VPN to ensure safe, legal hacking.
